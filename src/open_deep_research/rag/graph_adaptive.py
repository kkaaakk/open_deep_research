"""Adaptive expansion decision for GraphRAG.

This module determines whether graph expansion should be applied for a
particular query based on three heuristic signals:

1. Query specificity: ratio of long/capitalised tokens. Very generic
   queries (few long tokens) tend to benefit less from expansion.
2. Seed diversity: how many distinct sources the top seed results span.
   If seeds are already spread across many sources, expansion is more
   likely to add noise than value.
3. Term entropy: the average entropy of query terms in the corpus.
   If query terms are ultra-common (low entropy), neighbours are likely
   to be irrelevant.

Decision rule: expand only when **at least two** of the three signals are
favourable.
