"""Tool name conflict resolution via namespace-prefix wrapping.

Multiple MCP servers may expose tools with identical names (e.g., both
DBHub and another server could have a ``search`` tool). This module
provides explicit conflict detection and a safe wrapping strategy that
preserves the original tool's behaviour while giving each tool a unique,
server-scoped name such as ``dbhub__execute_sql``.
